# drum-kit-website
The Drum Kit Website is a fun and interactive web application that allows users to play different drum sounds by either clicking on the drum images or pressing corresponding keys on the keyboard. It's a great project to learn and practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by building an engaging musical experience right in the browser.
